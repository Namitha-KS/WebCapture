Webcapture
This project is a Chrome plugin for the web that allows users to highlight significant time stamps in a given video.

Users who utilise this tool will be more productive and less likely to miss any crucial details in a video. It is perfect for students and anyone who spends a lot of time watching YouTube.

Those who prefer not to take notes can use Web Capture because the timestamps can be effectively employed.
